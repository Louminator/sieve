# sieve
Some Python code to study and simulate a simple 1-dimensional sieve

In 2007, W. L. Gore and Associates brought a filtration problem to the Mathematical Problems in Industry workshop.
Some nice mathematics came out of it, including a very simple model for sieving.

Later, Suzanne Weekes, sponsored by the MAA, SIAM, NSF and the AMS, produced a series of mathematics videos 
called PICMath featuring industrial case studies including a series on filtration.

I am sharing some of the code I used.
